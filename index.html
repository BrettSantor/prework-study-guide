      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML is the structure or bones of the webpage</li>
        <li>There are two main elements that make up the webpage known as parent elements </li>
        <li>The &lt;head&gt; element contains information about the webpage</li>
        <li>Inside the head element you can use metadata tags such as &lt;title&gt;, &lt;style&gt;, &lt;base&gt;, &lt;link&gt; and &lt;meta&gt;</li>
        <li>The &lt;body&gt; element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
        <li>Inside the &lt;body&gt; element you can use tags such as &lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;li&gt;</li>
        <li> Elements inside the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&lt; elements are known as child elements</li>
        <li>Element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag</li>
        <li>tag refers only to what is inside the angle brackets &lt; &gt;</li>
        <li>Elements start and stop with tags. An example would be &lt;head&gt;metadata goes here&lt;/head&gt;</li>
        <li>Semantic html elements are elements that are named after its content and role it plays on a webpage</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of the element</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
        <li>You can use inline CSS to directly to html file but must be edited individually when you make a change</li>
        <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules in the head section of the html file and only apply to that page</li>
        <li>External style sheet are the preferred method since keeping CSS rules in a seperate file makes design changes easier</li>
        <li>To use an external style sheet you must &lt;link&gt; it in the html &lt;head&gt;</li>
        <li>Every html element is in a box consisting of Margin, Border, Padding and Content. This is known as CSS box model</li>
